### What is this repository for? ###

* The Meteor Ping Daemon is a web tool for quick and easy testing of sensor gateways.  
* Version 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* All you need to run the daemon is a web browser and meteor. To install meteor follow the instructions [here](https://www.meteor.com/install). With meteor installed set the project directory as your current directory and run the command "meteor". If you are testing a server running on the same computer you will have to run the daemon on a separate port (standard for meteor is 3000), to do this instead use the command "meteor run --port portnumber" and replace portnumber with your desired port.
